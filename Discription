Project Description:

This project introduces a pioneering approach to dermatological diagnosis by integrating quantum computing with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures like ResNet50 and InceptionNet. Our method leverages 
Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), combining the power of quantum mechanics with the traditional advantages of deep learning to enhance both the speed and accuracy of skin disease diagnosis.
By incorporating quantum computing, our QCNN model can detect subtle, early-stage dermatological disorders that often go unnoticed with conventional approaches. The quantum enhancement allows for more precise
pattern recognition, improving diagnostic outcomes and enabling the identification of skin abnormalities at their nascent stages, which can be crucial for timely and effective treatment.

Key features of this project include:

Quantum-enhanced deep learning using QCNN to outperform traditional models.
Improved diagnostic speed and accuracy, particularly for detecting subtle skin disorders.
Early-stage detection of dermatological diseases, revolutionizing patient outcomes.
New tools for comprehensive dermatological care, with a focus on leveraging quantum computational advantages.
