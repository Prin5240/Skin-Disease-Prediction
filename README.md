Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Advanced Dermatological Diagnosis  -
This project leverages Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) integrated with classical deep learning models like ResNet50 to revolutionize the diagnosis of skin diseases. By combining quantum 
computing with sophisticated image processing, this approach enables faster and more accurate detection of dermatological disorders, particularly at early stages. The project is designed to enhance 
the precision and efficiency of dermatological diagnosis through an advanced data processing pipeline.

This project integrates classical deep learning and quantum computing for the early detection and diagnosis of skin diseases. By utilizing ResNet50 for initial feature extraction and QCNN for quantum-enhanced
data processing, the project aims to improve both the accuracy and speed of diagnosing dermatological disorders.
